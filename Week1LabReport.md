If you need to install VScode on a computer then follow these steps:
1. Navigate to https://code.visualstudio.com/, and follow the instructions provided by the website.

If your VScode fails to install or you are having other difficulties installing it please reread the instructions on
the website.

## SSH connections
In this section we are going to connect to a remote server using the GitBash terminal on VScode.
1. So open up VScode and create a new terminal window.

Your terminal should look like this:

2. Next enter the following `ssh` command. Replace "abc" with your unique 3 characters from the end of your course account.  
For example: The account: `cs15lwi23abs`. `cs15lwi23` is the first part of the account and `abc` are the last three characters that will be unique to you.

A successful login should look as follows:

## Trying some commands

Here is a list of useful commands that you can run on the remote server:
1. `pwd` - print working directory
2. `cd` - change directory
3. `ls` <path> - list files and folders in path
4. `cd ~` - change to parent directory

Try to look at another students directory as well as explore your own.
